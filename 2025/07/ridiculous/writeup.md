Ridiculous or not ridiculous? Swipe and judge. 

## Slide 1
Person A, 1600 AD, colonies: The genocide of an entire indigenous tribe for the benefit of your empire is morally wrong.

Yes/No

## Slide 2
Person A, 1800 AD, USA: Slavery is wrong.  
Racist slave owner: It is not right to guilt trip me about my slave owning habits. We are the whites and we have the right to enslave those who are not. 

Is the slave owner's statement ridiculous?  
Yes/No

Suggestion: picture of black American slaves from the period

## Slide 3
Person A, 1900 AD (even today, in many places), India: Caste-based oppression is morally wrong.  
Casteist oppressor: It is not okay to guilt trip me about my religiously rooted beliefs of caste hierarchy. It is my right to continue practising untouchability. 

Is the caste supremacist's statement ridiculous?  
Yes/No

Suggestion: picture of oppressed caste person not allowed the to drink water from a well? or a picture of a person doing manual scavenging (may not be 1900 AD appropriate). or something else that is representative of the victim being oppressed.  

## Slide 4 
Person A, 2025 AD, India: Marital rape is wrong. You should not violate your spouse's consent.   
Rapist spouse: it is not okay to guilt trip me about my habits in our marital bed. I have the right to do to my spouse whatever I please.  
 
Is the rapist spouse's statement ridiculous?  
Yes/No

Suggestion: clipping of court ruling from 2025 that marital rape is not illegal  

## Slide 5 
Why did you find these statements ridiculous?  
Perhaps because you read them from the victims' point of view in each case?   

There is one last statement for you to judge...  

## Slide 6 
Person A: Rape, slavery, exploitation, and murder of innocent animals for human benefit is morally wrong.   

Animal oppressing human: It is not right to guilt trip me about my food choices.   

Is this statement equally ridiculous?   
Yes/No

Suggestion: picture of 3-4  most commonly farmed animals, including a buffalo being milked.  

## Slide 7
If you did not find the last statement ridiculous, is it because you CHOSE NOT to read it from the victims' perspective when the victims are animals?

Note: I know slide 6 only mentions food choices. But that is usually what the retort is from people. And this post is intended as a response to that retort.
